Because I have both datasets (training and testing) as well as the filter (which behaves like a predictor), I can just look into the training dataset, and compare that against the response from the filter. From this, I gather TP, TN, FP, and FN, just like a learning a problem. TP happens to be very small, that is, for a large N, the random selection makes it unlikely I have overlapping\u00a0items (but they don&#39;t matter), TN is large, FP matches the theoretical\u00a0results extremely well, and FN is zero (as expected). This worked out well for me.</p>"
