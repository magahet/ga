      "content": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today in office hours we worked through an example FFT problem, 2.9a), a sort of prequel to the homework problem, 2.9b). I sort of glossed over the inverse FFT transform because I was having a bit of difficulty finding the best way to explain it so I wanted to post a follow-up here to clarify any lingering questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For the inverse FFT, we&#39;re doing the same process but taking the roots in reverse order. So we use that same relation\u00a0$$A(\\omega_n)=A_e(\\omega_n^2)&#43;\\omega_nA_o(\\omega_n^2)$$ where\u00a0$$\\omega_n=e^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}}$$ except instead\u00a0of\u00a0$$k:0 \\to n-1$$, we have the reverse order:\u00a0$$k:n-1 \\to 0$$. This corresponds to doing the four equations I wrote out from bottom to top when taking the inverse. After you get the result of this inverse FFT, you divide all the coefficients by n to complete the inverse. With that I hope you&#39;ll be able to see how to do the computation in conjunction with what was discussed in office hours today.</p>",
