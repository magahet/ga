But it&#39;s fair to assume that the threshold for a B will be in the 60-65% range and A will be in the low 80&#39;s.  There is no extra credit but the nice thing about the final exam being worth a considerable amount is that you can really boost your grade.  And hopefully you&#39;ll do great on the final exam since you&#39;ve already learned the material and just need to refresh your memory.  I purposefully squeeze in a 3rd exam so that all of the material is covered on some midterm (except for some small bits in the last 2 lectures).  Final exams suck when you&#39;re going through them but they are really good in the end for solidifying it in your brain, so when you go to that technical interview in a few years you&#39;ll still be a master at DP.  --Eric"
