More precisely, these proofs have to be verifiable by deterministic computations that can be performed in polynomial time.\n\nEquivalently, the formal definition of NP is the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a theoretical non-deterministic Turing machine. This second definition is the basis for the abbreviation NP, which stands for &#34;nondeterministic, polynomial time.&#34; However, the verifier-based definition tends to be more intuitive and practical in common applications compared to the formal machine definition. The two definitions are equivalent because the algorithm for the machine definition consists of two phases, the first of which consists of a guess about the solution, which is generated in a non-deterministic way, while the second phase consists of a deterministic algorithm that verifies or rejects the guess as a valid solution to the problem",
