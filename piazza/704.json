If yes, then $$(x, y)$$ is a bottleneck edge. If no, then $$(x, y)$$ is not a bottleneck edge. If you need to increase the capacity of more than one edge at the same time to increase the flow, then none of these edges will be a bottleneck edge (and instead, you have a bottleneck path).<br /><br /></li><li>If you increase the capacity of a bottleneck edge in at least 1, you&#39;ll be augmenting the flow of the graph. This doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t increase the capacity in more units to keep augmenting the flow.<br /><br /></li><li>A property of a bottleneck edge is that it doesn&#39;t allow more flow to pass through (because it is at max capacity).
