I tried to help you out by breaking it into parts (a) and (b) and by problem 4 in the last homework.  \n\nThe solution is fairly easy after you see it.  E.g., for sets A=[3,4] and B=[0,2,3,4], I make the polynomials:\n  $$A(x) = x^3 &#43; x^4$$ and $$B(x) = 1 &#43; x^2 &#43; x^3 &#43; x^4$$.\nIn general if the number i is in set A then we add the term $$x^i$$ to the polynomial A(x) and similarly B(x) is defined based on the set B.\nThen we compute C(x) = A(x)B(x) using polynomial multiplication.  \nFor the above example, $$C(x) = x^3 &#43; x^4 &#43; x^5 &#43; 2x^6 &#43; 2x^7 &#43; x^8$$.\nThe coefficient 2 for the term $$x^6$$ means that there are 2 ways to add up to 6, namely 3&#43;3 and 4&#43;2.  In general, we read off the coefficients for the polynomial C(x) and that tells us the Cartesian sum of A and B.\n\n--Eric"

I saved it for last (except I never got to the extra credit), and then spent literally an hour on it and just couldn&#39;t get it. I finally decided it was very complicated, and attempted to write a complicated answer that I didn&#39;t finish in time. Hours later, I was at a concert with my daughter and was obsessively reviewing the problem, and I suddenly realized how ridiculously simple it is. It was like being kicked in the stomach.\n\nWhat I should have done is: 1) Realized that #1 had to have a simple answer. 2) Given up on #1 and done the extra credit. I almost surely could have done the extra credit problem in the hour that I wasted on #1, but I kept digging a hole, and I was dissuaded by the all-or-nothing grading for the extra credit and the fact that I wasn&#39;t really sure how many points it would be worth.\n\nWell, I&#39;m sure I did better than the score of 27 I got on my first HPC exam.

I whipped out my D&amp;C solution and managed to confuse my interviewer because it was the first solution he&#39;d seen without iterations. One of the myriad reasons I won&#39;t be pursuing employment there -- but it&#39;s great that I&#39;m already reaping the benefits of this class.\u00a0</p>"

After I woke up, I thought about the dream, and I realized that I had indeed answered that question wrong.\n\nBefore the exams were returned, I was talking to the the professor (my advisor), and I told him that sometimes I would solve problems in my sleep. I mentioned the dream and my realization that I gave the wrong answer on the real exam. He looked puzzled by that, and told me that no, I didn&#39;t answer the question wrong (he had graded but not returned the exam). But that confused me, because I really believed I&#39;d answered it wrong, and more than that, I was disturbed that I was wrong about being wrong.\n\nIn the next class session, exams were returned. I immediately turned to that problem and saw that I put the wrong answer. I was ecstatic. I took it up to the professor after class and pointed out that I was right about being wrong. I of course assumed he&#39;d want to lower my grade, but he said that if I could correct my mistakes in my sleep, I deserved the points."
