But I also do understand that without exams, there is no way to demonstrate knowledge either. In all my omscs courses I have trouble on the exams and a lot of it is time mgmt related (which is why I have heavily depended on projects to balance the grade-and\u00a0 the projects ARE like the real CS world)...its because I have to spend 20-30 minutes pondering over the questions before I can even get started writing anything. \u00a0 I also did them backwards...or maybe it was like 3-4-2-1 iirc.\u00a0 But I barely finished writing my first draft when time ran out, didn&#39;t have time to double check anything and probably didn&#39;t do very well..again...a much different environment than the HW where you can put in a lot of deep thought.\u00a0 I felt that I studied so much material and then the exam was only able to cover about 10-15% of what I had studied.\u00a0 Although its a good thing that #1 had the hint about using max flow reduction or I would have left it blank so maybe I did relatively ok on that one based on some of these comments.\u00a0 I hope we get graded on general high level concepts and not the level of detail that was required in the homeworks.\u00a0 Because for those it probably takes me an average of 2 hours just to figure out 1 problem.</p>"

How do you define a user friendly API, how can you make the code robust. \n\nMost computer science courses focus on the implementation details side of things (what&#39;s the OPTIMAL way to implement this idea). For example, I can have an API similar to a traditional Map where all operations run in O(n) time, and I&#39;d say the consumer facing design can still be good, but the implementation would be a bit lacking (since we could use hashing get to O(1))\n\nIn my experience, the most important factor differentiating people in the &#34;real world&#34; is the ability to write quality code, which is something not emphasized in school so much (have you ever been graded on the quality of your code here?). That will of course depend on the role, as some research oriented ones will lean more towards computer science fundamentals."

Of course code that runs in O(n^2) is &#34;less quality&#34; than one in O(n) if both implementations are straightforward.\n\nMy point was that, in the current world the bulk of what matters in software development is the ability to write well structured code without technical debt. This is mostly orthogonal with computer science and the things you learn in school. That doesn&#39;t mean the information isn&#39;t useful, just it&#39;s relatively less valuable when considering employability.
