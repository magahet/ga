We are not using a truly random hash function so there very well may be differences (better or worse) for the hash function you use.  There are also possible differences from small sample sizes, too small n or too few inserts/queries.  So that is the minimum for random hash functions. Nevertheless I would be surprised if you&#39;re getting below the theoretical rate, perhaps it&#39;s within the std dev.  Make sure you&#39;re doing the experiment a bunch of times (every time: choose new random seeds, new insertions, many queries, and compute the false positive rate) and then I&#39;d take the median of those rates and plot that.  I like the median because then outliers don&#39;t effect it as much.  But if you do enough trials it may not matter much if you do the mean or median.  John has more experience with the actual numbers...  --Eric"
