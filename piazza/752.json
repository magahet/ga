      "content": "Hi all,\n\nExam 2 will start at 8am on this Friday (10/20) and close at 8am on Monday.  The exam will cover graph algorithms and max-flow.  The exam will have 4 problems.  You will be given a new problem and then you need to design an algorithm for that new problem.  You will use the algorithms from class as a black-box as you&#39;ve been doing on the homeworks.  You will explain your algorithm in words, no pseudocode.  I won&#39;t tell you the desired running time; that&#39;s part of the challenge.  Faster -- and correct -- is worth more credit.  Note, naive algorithms may not receive (much or any) credit.  \n\nThe exam process will be the same as exam 1.  You will be given a blank exam template, probably tomorrow afternoon, that you can print out beforehand.  The exam will be administered through Proctortrack.  The exam counter will be set for 145 minutes, but you have only 120 minutes for the exam --- so make sure to finish writing the exam when the counter reaches 25 minutes.  (Yes, it&#39;d be great to have two counters, but I have no control over that, so no whining over the process please.)  And then you have the last 25 minutes to scan and upload your solutions to Gradescope.  I expect that you have figured out a reasonable system to do this by now.\n\nHere is the standard disclaimer that will I put at the top of the problems:\n\nStandard disclaimer: use the algorithms from class, such as DFS, Explore, BFS, Dijkstra\u2019s (using min-heaps), connected components, etc., as a black- box subroutine for your algorithm. If you attempt to modify one of these algorithms you will not receive full credit, even if it is correct. Make sure to explain your algorithm in words, no pseudocode.   Faster -- and correct -- is worth more credit.\n\nAs before I request that you stop posting publicly to Piazza on Thursday at midnight.  \n\nGood luck,  --Eric\n\n#pin",
