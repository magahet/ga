Is that actually the case, or will we be able to pass the course even if we aren&#39;t as good with that topic? As in,\u00a0do all the other topics build off of dynamic programming (meaning if I do not do well with this, I pretty much am guaranteed to not do well in the course) or are the topics after it on different concepts</p>",
