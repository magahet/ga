And although Edmonds Karp (EK) algorithm is supposed to be a type of FF algorithm, I&#39;m having a hard time understanding the condition where deleted edges get readded to the Residual network. I\u00a0know that the minimum capacity edge gets deleted from the residual graph every round and that edges may get added as a result of deleted edges as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On slide 4 of MF3, the professor states that &#34;<strong>edges may get added back in the residual graph, in particular an edge might get deleted in one round and added back in in a later round</strong>&#34;. I can&#39;t seem to imagine the scenario that may see a deleted edge added back in. I thought that after an edge gets deleted in the residual graph, we just continue looking for an augmenting path among the remaining edges.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can an instructor or a student who has full grasp of this &#34;adding back deleted edges&#34; concept do me a huge favor and explain the concept, maybe with an example if possible?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Soe</p>",
