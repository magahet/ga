It&#39;s more of a translation problem - &#34;do I understand what is being asked from this particular choice of wording&#34; more than a &#34;do I understand how FFT works and why it&#39;s a O(n lg n) divide and conquer algorithm&#34; problem. As such, it seemed inordinately difficult for a limited time exam. \n\nAnother challenge with longer (worded) problems is the layout in proctor-track makes it so you can&#39;t see the whole problem (you must always scroll up and down to see the entirety of the problem). I literally spent 15 minutes trying to decipher the problem prior to realizing there was more explanation at the bottom. I ran out of time as well. \n\nOne conclusion I reached from part 1 of this course is that it&#39;s worthwhile to have  CLRS book with it&#39;s online answers as a study aide for this course. Using an Algorithms book where homework question answers do not seem to be available online (I could not find them anyway - perhaps they charge for them?) makes the learning process more difficult and less fun (for me anyway). There are times when I just don&#39;t get an answer but after looking it up have the &#34;ah ha!&#34; moment. In the absence of answers it&#39;s mostly just a time consuming and at times frustrating search to find a well written answer online otherwise."
