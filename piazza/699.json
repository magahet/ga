Eventually I came to the realization that you can do this, as it hinges on if there is an original path literally leading to t (that is to say, edge xt, where x is any vertex other than t); this edge cannot and will never have a back-edge, and this fact means that the only way you can re-route traffic willy-nilly is IF an original terminating edge to t is not at capacity.</p>"
