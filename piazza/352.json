Here is my experience and some feedback:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1st try - Unsuccessful: I was using my Surface tablet that has Microsoft Edge browser. The Procter track didn&#39;t work well on Edge and I got an error. Then I tried on a chrome and it worked fine. After login, I saw the test, but when I tried to scan the document I got an error, (Scanner not available or something). So I ended the test and thought of trying it from my Windows 10 laptop. This is the error due to the computer I was using.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2nd try (Successful) : Used my Windows laptop, chrome browser and the test opened just fine. I was able to scan documents as well. I scanned 6 pages, front and back, converted them to PDF, uploaded to the gradescope, matched the pages as per the questions and did submit. The entire process from feeding the document to scanner to submit took about &#34;16 minutes&#34;. Although it took more time then I expected, but I was successful in completing all the steps.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lesson learnt - Use a laptop, chrome browser, and do a test scan before you start the proctoring. Do not wait till the end (120 mins) to start the scanning. It may take 20 mins or so... so plan accordingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, my scanner is NOT visible from my desk as it is sitting under a table in the corner of the room. I will move my scanner in the line of sight before the exam, so that I can be visible while I am scanning the documents.\u00a0</p>"

I tried scanning sheets writted with pen and pencil. Pencil wasnt bad really, so I will use pencil so that its easier to erase rather than striking out things.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) Remember to put your cell phone in airplane mode with only wifi enabled (also enabled\u00a0&#34;do not disturb&#34; to avoid any notification noise).\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) Also, after scanning with camscanner, I uploaded to google drive and waited for upload to be complete (around 2MB). Then instead of clicking gradescope link from proctortrack, i opened another tab in chrome and then opened gradescope myself. It luckily had autofil of my password and automatically logged in. Once i submitted, I came back to proctor track tab. Then I noticed that I had to open gradescope from the link provided. After selecting &#34;yes&#34; for &#34;submitted to gradescope&#34; option, I clicked the link to gradescope again from Q4 page of proctortrack (just to test it out). To my surprise, it asked for my uname/password which I didnt remember. So another thing to remember is to write down any uname/password and also to click gradescope link from proctortrack directly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All the best!</p>"
