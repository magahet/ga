If exam 2 was shifted forward a week and the project due this past Monday, I think that <br />A) this would allow graders for exam 2 to take their time.\u00a0 <br />B) Traditionally, people do far better on projects than tests; I feel even if most people didnt get their project grade back before the W date they would be able to correctly guess their grade.<br /><br />Just a thought!
