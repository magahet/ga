At least the first exam I felt covered a very large breadth of material, I would have liked to focus on the individual topics a bit more! The second exam was more thematically consistent. Another idea is to possibly add in short/answer multiple choice (similar to the section on exam 1), so that the exam results are more granular. It would be nice to get some credit for having insights to a problem even if you end up with a poor algorithm. Though I think future classes will benefit from hearing the experiences of prior ones."

I don&#39;t want to reduce any of the theoretical components of the class and I realize they require additional time to do, but I figure for many students who struggle with the theoretical aspects they give you a chance to boost your grade a bit.  In the past, for the on-campus class I did 2 programming projects: Bloom filters and PageRank.  We only did 1 this semester (we are not doing PageRank) because it&#39;s a hassle to organize these things.\n\nIn retrospect, would you have preferred more, less, or the same number of projects?\n<br/> [o] More projects\n[o] Same number (=1)\n[o] No projects",
