Expressed in DP terms we have to find  max from a set of profits where each value corresponds to profit at location i.  To answer P1 of your Q, for loop is trying to cycle thru various possible profits possible for each location i, if the preceding location was at j where mj - mi &lt;=k.   At the end of for loop we will be left with a set of profits possible if there was a YD at location i. From this we return max value to determine the maximum possible value."
