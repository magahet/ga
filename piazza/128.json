I&#39;m seeing your hint here and I&#39;m working through smaller sub problems. For instance: 2^5 mod 7 (answer 4) yields 2^-1 which is an inverse in mod 7. I was going down a path of egcd but that isn&#39;t necessarily a simpler solution to the problem at hand. I&#39;m seeing inverses of 2 to be things like -3 and 4 which are in the same class. Might be going down a rabbit hole here.</p>\n<p></p>"
