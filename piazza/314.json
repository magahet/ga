I have one question about it, which is that you don&#39;t seem to account for the fact that you cannot cut at every i/j within $$1,\\dots,n$$. So, if we let $$c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_m$$ be the locations of the cuts (and $$c_0 = 0$$ and $$c_{m&#43;1}=n$$), I think we\u00a0want to vary i and j from 0 to m&#43;1 and have our &#34;root&#34; cost be $$c_j-c_i$$ and our goal be $$S(0,m&#43;1)$$. The other &#34;gotcha&#34; for me was identifying the base case - $$S(i,i&#43;1)=0$$.</p>"
