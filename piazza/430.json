File upload took around 2 to 3 minutes, and I was kinda scared. With OMS, PT issues have been inevitable. So I resigned to the fact that we can get some kind of help from PT support. Worst case, we can reason out with Prof and TAs on the problem. Keeping PT issues aside, 25 mins for scanning our answers was really sufficient kind of eased the tension.</p>"

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI hope you all did well on the exam.  We will do our best to grade it quickly, probably by Monday (10/2).  \n\nThere were many people who had issues with the system (Proctortrack crashing, scanning/uploading fiascoes, etc.).   Honestly, I&#39;m overwhelmed just reading all of them, and I&#39;m not sure how to respond to most since this is my first experience with an OMS class.  I don&#39;t want to penalize anyone because of system issues, but give me some time to discuss some of these issues with David Joyner etc. before I respond.  At this point, don&#39;t stress about it.   \n\nI have updated the class schedule to include the links to the videos for the next section of the class, see:  https://8803ga.wordpress.com/lecture-schedule/\nThe next exam will be on graph algorithms and max-flow algorithms.  Note, we will not cover the PageRank algorithm.  There is a lecture there (see GR4) if you&#39;re interested in PageRank, and perhaps we&#39;ll add it in to future iterations of the course (if I somehow do this again...).  I will post the next homework as soon as I get a handle on things. \n\nOnce you recover from the exam, you should focus on the Bloom filter project.  This topic will not be on the exam or homework, just on the project.  John Turner will run it; he&#39;ll do office hours this week and next to help you out (probably this Wednesday evening will be the first one).  Bloom filters are a really simple hashing scheme, that&#39;s quite useful.  Once you understand it, it should be quick to code it up.  In the lecture I prove some results about the theoretical performance of a Bloom filter.  (Sorry if I get a bit carried away with some of the probability stuff but that&#39;s the sort of stuff I love, and I wanted you to get some of the real intuition underlying it.)  These theoretical results are for random hash functions, which we, of course, don&#39;t have.  Your project will compare the actual performance of a simple Bloom filter implementation with the theoretical results.  John made a Python template to hopefully make it easier for you and for us (for the auto-grading).   You will also make a short report, this grading component will be subjective, but there are suggestions in the project description to help.  I hope you enjoy it.  Please do us a favor and don&#39;t post your code afterwards (such as on Github) in case we use this project again.\n\n--Eric",
