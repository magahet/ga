The most important aspect I&#39;ll stress: I&#39;ll try to get you to use the key ideas in the algorithms we&#39;ve seen in lecture to new problems on the homeworks and exams. \u00a0 For example, take the idea of the knapsack DP algorithm and apply it to a new DP problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--Eric</p>",
