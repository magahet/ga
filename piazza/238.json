For example if X = {2, 3, 5}, k = 1, and B=5, the T-Square solution (I may be mistaken) will return false because the recurrence is defined to take either the answer\u00a0$$T[i-1, n]$$, which is 2, or\u00a0$$T[i-1, b-X_i]$$, which is infinity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mine\u00a0solution is similar, to the T-Square solution but shoving the above case in there made it kind of weird. I&#39;m not sure my solution its completely right since it kind of loses track of which coins have been used.</p>"
