I usually just do a very quick high-level idea of the proof, see the end of my notes here:  https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vigoda/6505/Halting.pdf\nThe textbook also gives a quick high-level proof idea at the end of Section 8.3.  You first show Circuit-SAT is NP-complete.  So you have to argue that every problem in NP can be written as a circuit of AND, OR, NOT gates and input gates -- why?  Because there is an algorithm A to verify solutions, so the proposed solution is given in the input gates and the algorithm A is encoded with AND, OR, NOT gates.  That approach proves that the Circuit-SAT problem is NP-complete.  Then from the Circuit-SAT problem you can reduce it to the SAT problem.    --Eric",
