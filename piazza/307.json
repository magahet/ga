The lecture stated 2N-1 so I started with 8 roots of unity.  6 pages later I had a bunch of complicated reductions to do and hope I didn&#39;t make or hadn&#39;t already made a mistake. After trying 2.9a, I realized that the end result of 2.9b would be of order 3 so 4 roots of unity should be sufficient. I was then able to solve it in a much more straight forward way with less padding."
