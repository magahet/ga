Evidently these are statements that need to be proved for the larger proof to be true, but, I never quite got the hang of knowing when I could assume a truth as accepted true, or when I had to prove it. <br /><br />Then there are other things.\u00a0 So for example, one of the things I got burned on when I did them was my proofs weren&#39;t &#34;math-y&#34; enough; by that I mean I would say things like &#34;the sum of all of the foreground probabilities contained in the set of foregrounds&#34; instead of $$\\sum_{i \\varepsilon{} F } f_{i}$$ . I lost many points consistently for stuff like this.<br /><br />Its this kind of stuff I was asking about, and there are definite rules to them; I did learn these somewhat this past January / February, but I lost it and wasnt sure if I had to re-sharpen this into, well, at least an intimidating spoon. Knowing that we will have to do these again though I will start re-learning the language.<br /><br />Let me see if I can find that official, sanctioned free link for the class for &#39;Book of Proof&#39;.</p>"

So my question is: <em>are these proofs in the sense that we need a specific structure and method to answer them or are they a bit more casual?</em><br /><br />I ask because if so, I need to budget time this week to reading Book of Proof, which is freely and legally available as a PDF (last time I checked).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Brent</p>",
