Is it just that\u00a0it connects all vertices together\u00a0such that removing any edge leaves the tree disjoint, or does it also mean that this set of edges is\u00a0of minimum possible weight? a few times it has been discussed that there are multiple possible minimum spanning trees, such as problem 3) of our homework, where there is also another minimum spanning tree of weight &lt;= the weight of the original tree. But if the original tree is a minimum spanning tree, I thought this meant it had to be of minimal weight, so any other minimum spanning tree would have to be of equal weight... where am I miss-understanding?</p>",
