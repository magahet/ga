Here is my experience and some feedback:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>1st try - Unsuccessful: I was using my Surface tablet that has Microsoft Edge browser. The Procter track didn&#39;t work well on Edge and I got an error. Then I tried on a chrome and it worked fine. After login, I saw the test, but when I tried to scan the document I got an error, (Scanner not available or something). So I ended the test and thought of trying it from my Windows 10 laptop. This is the error due to the computer I was using.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2nd try (Successful) : Used my Windows laptop, chrome browser and the test opened just fine. I was able to scan documents as well. I scanned 6 pages, front and back, converted them to PDF, uploaded to the gradescope, matched the pages as per the questions and did submit. The entire process from feeding the document to scanner to submit took about &#34;16 minutes&#34;. Although it took more time then I expected, but I was successful in completing all the steps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lesson learnt - Use a laptop, chrome browser, and do a test scan before you start the proctoring. Do not wait till the end (120 mins) to start the scanning. It may take 20 mins or so... so plan accordingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, my scanner is NOT visible from my desk as it is sitting under a table in the corner of the room. I will move my scanner in the line of sight before the exam, so that I can be visible while I am scanning the documents.\u00a0</p>"

You should do the trial by Wednesday morning EST to let us know if there are any issues.  \n\nImportant:  The exam process: \n1. You will have a template to print beforehand (no need for this trial). \n2. When you are ready to take the exam, login to Proctortrack, the exam questions are posted there.\n3. While Proctortrack is ON you will scan your exam and upload to Gradescope.  You need to stay in the room so we can monitor you while you scan.  You can use a scanner attached to your computer or a phone.  You should be able to upload to Gradescope while Proctortrack is running.  During the actual exam, when you are finished with the exam (&lt;120 minutes of starting) you will hold up each page to your computer&#39;s camera so we can see your solutions.  After that you cannot make ANY changes (e.g., if you forgot to write your name, don&#39;t add it on -- if there are any changes we will just send your test to the GT Office of Student Integrity (OSI) for cheating.  Also, if you go over 120 minutes (it doesn&#39;t matter how much over) we will send it to the GT OSI.\n4. Afterwards, check the quality of the image you uploaded.  It is OK to use a phone if the image is of good quality.  If we can&#39;t read it, we can&#39;t give you credit.  We are not going to check your scan quality beforehand so please don&#39;t ask, that&#39;s your responsibility.\n5.  The exam will be setup to give you 130 minutes.  You are supposed to finish the exam in &lt;120 minutes and then you have 10 minutes to scan and upload it to GRADESCOPE.\n\n---From David Joyner re Proctortrack:\n\nThis message contains instructions for getting setup with Proctortrack. If you\u2019ve used Proctortrack in a previous class, you can stop reading: you\u2019ve already done all this.\n\nThis semester, we\u2019ll be having at least one proctored exam in this class. We administer proctored exams using a tool called Proctortrack by Verificient. Proctortrack uses your webcam, microphone, and screen capture to proctor your exam. These instructions will take care of getting you set up with Proctortrack so you will be ready when the exam window opens.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to do is complete the onboarding test. The onboarding test ensures your computer is ready to run Proctortrack and administer your exam. Accessing the onboarding test also ensures that you can access your Proctortrack account.\n\nFirst, go to testing.verificient.com. On the right, you\u2019ll see the account login area. Your username is your official Georgia Tech email address, not your alias. This is always &#64;gatech.edu; your Georgia Tech username is the one you use to log into T-Square. Typically, your login email will look something like djoyner3&#64;gatech.edu, although it may look more like daj3&#64;gatech.edu or gth815k&#64;gatech.edu.\n\nYou may have received your password in an email. If so, enter that password to log in. If not, walk through the Forgot Your Password dialog (found below the login box) to reset your password and log in.\n\nAfter logging in, you will see a list of available tests. Generally, the onboarding test will always be available. It will remain available even after you\u2019ve completed it once so that you can set up new computers if need be. Click the onboarding test, follow the prompts to install the software, and complete the onboarding process.\n\nOnce you have completed the onboarding test, you\u2019re ready to go!
