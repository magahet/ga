I felt as though I was expected to get everything perfectly without any practice, because the practice itself (hw) was worth so much of our grade. <br /><br />That said, it does put tremendous pressure on the exams. I hope they will test skill rather than speed. It always seems like exams are primarily about speed, which puts deep thinkers at a disadvantage and speed readers at an advantage.
