      "content": "<p>I know the test is about 2 weeks away, but I think that its probably a good idea for some of us to really start focusing on it. There has been a good deal covered in the first few weeks, and I am wondering what are the best areas to focus on vs the not so important. I feel like this is especially important for students who just are not very good at this sort of math, and students who are already putting 40&#43; hours a week into this course so they can maximize their study time and get the most out of the material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From what I am gathering, this is the list based on priority, that way, we can check each box as the test starts to approach and see where we really need to spend those last hours of crunch time. <strong>Can a TA or the Professor tell me if I am off, or missing something?</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> (Seems to be the most important, i.e. we cannot pass this course unless we know this)</p>\n<p>\u00a0- <strong>Substr</strong> and <strong>Subseq</strong> problems (Very important)</p>\n<p>\u00a0- <strong>Knapsack</strong> (Very important)</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Chain multiply (This didn&#39;t seem to be covered in the homework or practice problems, so I wonder if it is as important)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) Divide and Conquer</p>\n<p>- <strong>FFT</strong> (Very important)</p>\n<p>- Convolution (semi important needed for FFT)</p>\n<p>- How to use divide and conquer (semi important, but it seems like FFT is the most important part here)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) RSA</p>\n<p>- <strong>Extended Euclid</strong> and <strong>Fermat&#39;s little theorem</strong> (very important)</p>\n<p>- Proofs (semi important)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4) Recurrence relations in respect to run time (semi important)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, in theory, if we can do all the very important pieces without issue, we should be in a respectable position, even if we cannot do the other aspects as well, or not at all. I.e focus most of our study time on DP (specifically knapsack and problems involving min/max of substrings, sequences, etc.), FFT, and the 2 main algorithms for RSA, correct? So, say you spend 4 hours a day (just for an easy number). You should break it down into more or less:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DP - 1.5 hrs</p>\n<p>FTT - 1.5 hrs</p>\n<p>EE/FLT - .5 hrs</p>\n<p>Everything else - .5 hrs</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Again, not at all implying that we should not learn the other concepts, just that they are not as important for what the professor really wants us to get out of this course)</p>",
