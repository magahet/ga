I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t how it should be done. Do we have to maintain an array for U at all or just draw random number from range (0, N-1)? If we are supposed to draw randomly then couldn&#39;t a number be drawn twice and end up hashed to two different locations in n?\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
